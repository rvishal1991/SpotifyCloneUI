# 🎵 Spotify Clone UI – SwiftUI

A high-fidelity clone of Spotify’s user interface built with SwiftUI. This project was created to explore and practice modern SwiftUI techniques including navigation, overlays, animations, image lazy loading, and complex scrollable layouts.

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 **SwiftUI-Based UI**: Modern and responsive UI built entirely with SwiftUI.
- 🧭 **Navigation Stack & Overlays**: Smooth in-app navigation and modal presentations.
- 🎞️ **Animations**: Basic animations to enhance interactivity and visual polish.
- 🖼️ **Lazy Image Loading**: Efficient image loading for performance optimization.
- 🔄 **Nested Scroll Views**: Vertical scrolling lists within horizontal carousels, mimicking Spotify’s home screen.
